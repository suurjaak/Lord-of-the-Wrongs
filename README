Lord of the Wrongs is a card creator application written in Delphi, a parody
of the Lord of the Rings trading card game (created by a company called
Decipher Inc., discontinued by now). The Fellowship characters can be you and
your friends, the Shadow races consist of various kinds of alcohol, and the
objective is to survive the damage from late afternoon to early morning.

Currently there are 4 defined races: Fellowship, Soft Drink, Medium Drink,
Strong Drink. The races and their images can be changed in the database
directly.



USING THE PROGRAM
-----------------

LOTW runs under Windows and should require nothing external. If a database
file is not found in the application directory, an empty one is created.
